One step process to remove pingbacks and trackbacks and leave only real user opinions in your posts comments.

== Description ==

When your blog posts receive pingbacks and trackbacks usually they are displayed together with user opinions.

But if you don't like to see this additional data, or you think pingbacks and trackbacks are not valuable for your blog, here is a tool to remove them.

This plugin allows you to delete all pingbacks and trackbacks comments from your blog, leaving only user comments.

Furthermore turns to <b>closed</b> the ping status of existing posts still allowing new notifications, avoiding them future pingbacks or trackbacks.

And for new posts, to avoid more notifications, updates the default post <i>ping status</i> value to <b>closed</b> (this option is available in Discussion Settings section).

Full support for any kind of custom post types. There is a filter for developers if you want to exclude a particular post type.

This plugin provides a single one step form to do these changes, but previously it's strongelly recommended you perform a database backup.

Once completed this process, you will not receive more pingbacks or trackbacks unless you do not change posts or blog notifications configuration.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I know if I need to delete pingbacks and trackbaks? =

You can delete them if you are tired of pingback/trackback spam or continuous validation to approve them, or just if you consider a chaos to mix them with comments or it's an irrelevant info. But if you think it's something important to reference other blogs or topics, and provide your users more scope about the posts content, then you should not delete them.
